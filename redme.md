I promise you’ll never want to order delivery again after you see how easy it is to make pizza at home using fresh ingredients.

This recipe includes instructions for how to create a chewy crust that’s lightly crisp on the bottom using all-purpose flour or bread flour. It makes a dough that is far better (and cheaper!) than any store bought dough or restaurant pizza I have tried.

Even the tomato sauce is made from scratch! It’s wonderfully simple and flavorful, and is the perfect base for layering on lots of cheese and your choice of toppings.
